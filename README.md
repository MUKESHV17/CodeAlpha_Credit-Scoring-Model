# CodeAlpha Credit Scoring Model

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a **Credit Scoring Model** using multiple classification machine learning algorithms. The objective is to predict the creditworthiness of individuals based on historical data, helping financial institutions assess loan eligibility. The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. The dataset is split into training (`train.csv`) and testing (`test.csv`) files, with the performance of various classification models compared using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

## Features
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Implementation of a variety of classification algorithms for comparison.  
- **User-Friendly Code**: Modular structure for easy understanding and extension.  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: In-depth evaluation for better decision-making.  
- **Dataset Splitting**: Separate training (`train.csv`) and testing (`test.csv`) datasets for reproducible results.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of:  
- **`train.csv`**: Used for model training.  
- **`test.csv`**: Used for model testing and validation.  
Both files contain features describing individual characteristics and a target variable indicating creditworthiness.

## Implementation
### Steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing values.  
   - Encoding categorical variables.  
   - Scaling numerical features.  

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Feature selection and dimensionality reduction (if applicable).  
   - Deriving meaningful features to enhance model performance.  

3. **Model Training**  
   - Various classification models implemented include:  
     - Logistic Regression  
     - Decision Trees  
     - Random Forest  
     - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
     - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
     - Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, etc.)  
     - Neural Networks  

4. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Accuracy  
   - Precision  
   - Recall  
   - F1-score  
   - ROC-AUC  

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**  
   - Grid Search and Random Search applied for optimal parameter selection.
